## About

Micro-Ritual Designer helps users create and maintain small, meaningful rituals (1-5 minutes) that transform ordinary moments into opportunities for connection, reflection, and intentionality. Unlike typical habit trackers or productivity apps, Micro-Ritual Designer focuses on meaning and presence rather than achievement.

## Features

- **Personalized Ritual Creation**: Design rituals aligned with your values, schedule constraints, and physical environment
- **Multi-step Creation Process**: Guided workflow for defining ritual elements, triggers, and environment
- **Dashboard**: Track active rituals and see your daily schedule
- **Reflection System**: Record thoughts and rate meaningfulness after completing rituals
- **Performance Tracking**: View statistics and historical reflections
- **Notification System**: Get reminders when it's time for your rituals
